# Hello, welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

## About me

My name is Marques, I'm 21 years old. I have been working with IT for 3 years. I started with technical internship in support at CBMES. Today I work at the _Hospital Estadual De UrgÃªncia e EmergÃªncia_ in _VitÃ³ria ES_, as a web developer. I started as a web developer with PHP, using XAMPP installed on a desktop, the files were very messy. With the time I had to create and maintain these systems, I took the opportunity to try to improve the structure. Today we have a dedicated Linux server, with Docker installed and configured with production and development environments, working with NodeJS and ReactJS and soon we will have an institutional App too. We still have a lot to improve but I'm very happy with the progress made to date.
